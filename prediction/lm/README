Hi,

this is a Python extension for an updatable n-gram language
model meant to be used for word prediction in onscreen keyboards.
Beware! This is pre-alpha material, expect show stopping bugs.

Some design goals are:
 - N-gram language models of order two and up, 
   however order three is the main target
 - N-gram smoothing with Kneser-Ney interpolation
 - Support On-line adaptation, i.e. allow for continous learning 
 - Unicode support, UTF-32 internally 
 - low memory usage
 - few build and runtime dependencies

Not done yet:
 - word filtering
 - LM caching 
 - LM interpolation
 - decrease loading time of large language models

Comments, bugs? mailto:marmvta@gmail.com


How to build
------------

Make sure you have a working gcc tool-chain and python development files. 
For Ubuntu 9.10:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential python2.6-dev

Then run:
      
    make


Training a language model
-------------------------

First get a training text. Any reasonably large text file ought to work 
for now. The sample below uses Herman Melville's Moby Dick, available 
from Project Gutenberg at

     http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701.txt

Then run

    ./train moby.txt 3 moby.lm

This reads the training text, trains a language model of order 3, i.e.
collecting unigrams, bigrams and trigrams and saves it to moby.lm.


Prediction
----------

    ./predict moby.lm this Moby ""

This loads the model and prints a list of words in decreasing 
probability following "this Moby".
