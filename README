Onboard 0.98.0
--------------

Description:

    Onboard is an onscreen keyboard useful for everybody that cannot use a
    hardware keyboard; for example TabletPC users, mobility impaired users,...

    It has been designed with simplicity in mind and can be used right away
    without the need of any configuration, as it can read the keyboard layout
    from the X server. 

    Among its features are:
    - Support of custom layouts through the use of xml and svg files.
    - Support of custom themes for the appearance through the use of xml files.
    - Support of macros to automatically type custom defined texts.
    - Support of <modifier>+<mouseclick> combination.
    - Toggling mouse buttons to perform right clicks with the left mouse button.
    - Control of the hover click feature provided by the system.
    - Minimizing the keyboard to the panel, a trayicon, or a floating icon.
    - Support for scanning.


D-Bus Interface:

Once running, Onboard provides a simple builtin D-Bus service under
the bus name org.onboard.Onboard. The single available interface
org.onboard.Onboard has the following methods:

Show()
  Show the keyboard window.
  No return value.

  If auto-show is enabled, the window is locked visible, i.e.
  auto-hiding is suspended until Onboard is hidden either manually
  or by calling the D-Bus method "Hide". This is the same bahavior as if
  Onboard was shown by user action, e.g. by status menu, floating icon
  or by starting a second instance.

  Example:
    dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.onboard.Onboard
    /org/onboard/Onboard org.onboard.Onboard.Show

Hide()
  Hide the keyboard window.
  No return value.

  Example:
    dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.onboard.Onboard
    /org/onboard/Onboard org.onboard.Onboard.Hide

IsVisible() -> Boolean
  Returns True if the window is currently visible, False otherwise.

  Example:
    dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.onboard.Onboard
    /org/onboard/Onboard org.onboard.Onboard.IsVisible
