* Always_underscore_variable_names, no CamelCase.

* Don't leave commented out code lying around.

* Use the Logger instead of print statements.

* Lines shouldn't be longer than 80 characters.

* Docstrings on class members.

* Don't let gconf leak out of the Config singleton.  Don't use gconf directly in
any other class.

* Code like config.x = x doesn't seem to cause infinite loops for me.  If it is
put the code to prevent it in the Config singleton itself.

* Probably not much point making local references to things which are in gconf.
  eg. self.x = config.x  If we find that getting things from gconf is slow we
  should cache the values in the Config singleton.
