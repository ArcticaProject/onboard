  <title>Key behaviours</title>

  <p>The keys on the panes of <app>Onboard</app> do not all behave the same way. How each key behaves depends on its definition in the layout file.</p>

  <p>We distinguish the following behaviours for the keys:</p>

  <terms>
    <item>
      <title>Immediate keys</title>
      <p>Typical examples of such keys on the <em>Compact Onboard</em> layout are the keys with letters.</p>
  <p>A <key>left mouse button click</key> on such a key immediately sends the corresponding letter to the system.</p>
  <p>A <key>left mouse button down and hold</key> on most keys either repeats the clicked character until release or opens a <gui>popup</gui> where the user can choose an alternative. Most of the time, the alternative is the clicked letter with a diacritical mark. The behaviour of the key depends on a setting in <gui>Preferences of Onboard</gui>; by default <app>Onboard</app> is configured to show the popup.</p>

      <title>Locking keys</title>
      <p>On the <em>Compact Onboard</em> layout, the <key>Caps Lock</key> modifier is a locking key.</p>
  <p>A click with the <key>left mouse button</key> on the key activates it. The <key>Caps Lock</key> modifier remains locked in its active state until the user clicks a second time with the <key>left mouse button</key> on it.</p>
   </item>
    <item>
      <title>Latching and locking keys</title>
      <p>Examples of such keys are  most <key>modifier</key> keys or the <key>layer buttons</key> to switch the layout to a different layer.</p>
  <p>By default, a <key>left mouse button</key> click on such a key latches the key. This means that the key remains active until another <key>left mouse button</key> click occurs elsewhere. If for example the user clicks on the <key>Shift</key> modifier, it remains active until he clicks for example on a <key>letter</key> key.</p>

  <p>However, if after latching the modifier the user clicks another time on the same modifier, the modifier gets locked: the modifier remains active regardless of where the user clicks, until he clicks another time on the locked modifier, which releases it. For example, if the user clicks two consecutive times on the <key>Shift</key> modifier, the <key>Shift</key> modifier gets locked. This is among others useful when typing a word with only capital letters in order to not having to reactivate the <key>Shift</key> modifier after typing each letter. Once he is done with writing the word in capital letters, he can click on the <key>Shift</key>  modifier to release it.</p>

 <p>The default behaviour of the modifiers on consecutive <key>left mouse button</key> clicks is to cycle through the states of latched, locked and inactive. However, this behaviour can be changed in the <gui>Preferences of Onboard</gui>. It is for example possible to set the modifiers to lock on a double click instead of cycling.</p>
